# Game of Life

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It simulates the life cycle of cells on a grid, following simple rules that result in complex, evolving patterns.

## How It Works

The game consists of a grid of cells, where each cell can be either **alive** or **dead**. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by its neighbors:

1. **Any live cell** with 2 or 3 live neighbors **survives**.
2. **Any dead cell** with exactly 3 live neighbors **becomes alive**.
3. **All other live cells die** in the next generation.

The process repeats over multiple iterations, starting with an initial configuration of live and dead cells.

## Features

- Grid-based simulation.
- Interactive or random initial conditions.
- Visual display of cell evolution.
- Simple but powerful rules leading to diverse patterns.
