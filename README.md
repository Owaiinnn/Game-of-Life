# Game-of-Life
The Game of Life, created by Cambridge mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton, not a typical game. Popularized in a 1970 Scientific American article, it features a grid of cells that live, die, or multiply based on simple rules. Starting conditions lead to evolving patterns during the game.
